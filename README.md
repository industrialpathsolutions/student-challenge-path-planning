Student challenge path planning
===============================

This repository contains details for the coding challenge announced during
student fairs at Chalmers, November 2023.

Background
----------

Much of the IPS software relies on fast computations of collision free paths.
The path planning algorithms are thus central and need to be both fast and
efficient. The path planning algorithm is used for cable optimization, robot
planning as well as our IMMA model.

In this challenge, we provide a planning task consisting of several cubes in a
box, a start position (example in green) and end position (red in example). The
task is to find a collision free path from start to end in an as computationally
efficient manner as possible. The problem information is provided in a human
readable file format and the solutions will be tested on different
configurations of the boxes.

You propose a solution and submit it to us, and we will evaluate the
contributions in terms of 

* computational efficiency, 
* code and algorithm cleverness, and 
* code readability. 

We will test your code on a 16 core AMD 7950x with a NVIDIA RTX 3090.

How to submit a solution?
-------------------------

Submit your solution by sending us a mail at recruit@industrialpathsolutions.com
with a link to a code repository on GitHub or GitLab. The deadline for
submission is January 15.
